Customers get shipping options of various carriers based on shopping cart content. You get shipping labels and tracking codes automatically.

== Description ==

Shipfunk Logistics Platform offers you a flexible way to differentiate from your competitors. With Shipfunkâ€™s platform you can offer your customers multiple shipping options (i.a. Posti, Matkahuolto, DB Schenker, GLS, DHL and UPS) and extensive amount of pick-up -sites, as well as all-in-one tracking site and returns portal. All shipping options are fully adjustable to achieve better customer experience. We generate package labels and EDI -messages, so the system is scalable to high volume.

You can generate labels easily from the plugin or on our Extranet (no need to use e.g. Posti SmartShip/Prinetti).

You do not need to pay any fixed service fees, starting fees or monthly fees. You pay only per use.

This new version communicates with our new API and it has a different authentication system - you need to input your new API key(s) to continue using the plugin! Please, check your new API keys from Shipfunk Extranet -> Account -> API keys before you update. After updating the plugin save the API keys to the plugin settings (WooCommerce -> Settings -> Shipping -> Shipfunk). We have also a new setting: default product dimensions, which you can configure. The setting is used when a product does not have dimensions set.
